# The 25 Days of Christmas 2020

This is a simple implementation for the challenges at [Advent of Code
2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). Enjoy!

## Details

Each solution was created via `cargo new --vcs none day_NN`, and
(usually) have an independent `src/part1.rs` and `src/part2.rs`, so you
can easily see what was changed to finish the second half.

I focused on a balance between code readability and writing speed: I
want to get these done quickly, but I also want to come back at some
point and figure out what I did.

## Comments

### Day 1

Love the story! I [need a
vacation](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1), too.

### Day 2

Trying to use more idiomatic Rust
[today](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/2), which includes `impl
FromStr`. I imagine I'll be seeing a lot of that.

### Day 3

Maybe this use of `FromStr` is overkill?
[Nah](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3).

### Day 4

OK, `List` could have just been a simple function in [this
solution](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4). I need to stop with the
`FromStr` already.

### Day 5

For some reason, I found [today's
problem](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/5) very easy. Guess I'm just
a binary thinker.

### Day 6

Part 1 of [today's problem](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/6) was
much easier than part 2. I eventually just did a manual set comparison
with a special case for the first person, which seems a bit hack.

### Day 7

Digging the `FromStr` again for [today's
problem](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7). So much string
breakdowns, almost seems like I should have written a grammar or
something.
